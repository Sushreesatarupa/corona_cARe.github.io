# corona_cARe
## Inspiration
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created a global health crisis that has had a deep impact on the way we perceive our world and our everyday lives. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak a global health emergency and on March 11, 2020, as a global pandemic. Since the initial outbreak, SARS-CoV-2, has spread to 216 countries around the world. It has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. Life during this pandemic has been boring and even stressful for some. Checking various sites to know about coronavirus has been difficult for some people.

## What it does
Corona_Care is an all in one website. It includes all the information regarding corona virus. The website also shows live statistics of the virus in various countries. We have also included a world map showing the statistics of the virus. We have included Play zone in our website where various games are available. This might help to reduce your stress.

## How we built it
We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Firebase for the website. Games were made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We have used echoAR to create some more fun elements for the website.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time to work with echoAR. We had many bugs from the starting. We weren't even familiar with Firebase.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite all the obstacles, we are really happy that we could incorporate all our ideas into our website. We even learnt many new things and we are proud of ourselves!

## What's next for Corona_Care
We will try to include more things like a community feature, in which people can talk to each other and share things. We also want to include a face mask detecting model. If possible we will add more AR ideas.
